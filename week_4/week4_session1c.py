Problem #3: Add Two Numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

Input: 2 -> 4 -> 3,  5 -> 6 -> 4
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807

UMPIRE  
Understand what the interviewer is asking for by using test cases and questions about the problem.  
Match what this problem looks like to known categories of problems, e.g. Linked List or Dynamic Programming and strategies or patterns in those categories.  
Plan the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.  
Implement the code to solve the algorithm.  
Review the code by running specific example(s) and recording values (watchlist) of your code's variables along the way.  
Evaluate the performance of your algorithm and state any strong/weak or future potential work.
