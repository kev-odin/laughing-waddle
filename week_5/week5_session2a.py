Problem #1: Evaluate Postfix expression
Write a function to evaluate the value of an expression in postfix notation
represented by a string with numbers between 0 and 9 and operators separated by whitespace.
The expression supports 4 binary operators '+', '*', '-' and '/'.

Note: Arithmetic Expressions can be written in Infix, Prefix or Postfix notations.

Infix notations are human readable form of expression. For example: “3 + 4”.
Prefix notations has operators before the operands like “+ 3 4” for the previous infix example.
Postfix notations keep operators after operands. A postfix expression for the examples above would be “3 4 +”.
Play with this infix, prefix and postfix notations on this infix and postfix converter and build an intuition.

Example:

Input: "5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -"
Output: 14

The expression is evaluated as follows:
5 3 4 * + 3 -
5 12 + 3 -
17 3 -
14
