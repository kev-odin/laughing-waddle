Problem 1 - Moving Average from Data Stream

Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

Implement the MovingAverage class:

    MovingAverage(int size): Initializes the object with the size of the window size.
    double next(int val): Returns the moving average of the last size values of the stream.

Examples

Input
["MovingAverage", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[3], [1], [10], [3], [5]]
Output
[null, 1.0, 5.5, 4.66667, 6.0]

Explanation
MovingAverage movingAverage = new MovingAverage(3);
movingAverage.next(1); // return 1.0 = 1 / 1
movingAverage.next(10); // return 5.5 = (1 + 10) / 2
movingAverage.next(3); // return 4.66667 = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
movingAverage.next(5); // return 6.0 = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3

UMPIRE
Understand what the interviewer is asking for by using test cases and questions about the problem.
Match what this problem looks like to known categories of problems, e.g. Linked List or Dynamic Programming and strategies or patterns in those categories.
