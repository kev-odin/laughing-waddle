Problem 2 (Challenge) - Longest Consecutive Subsequence
Given an unsorted array of integers, we want to find
the length of the longest subsequence such that elements 
in the subsequence are consecutive integers. The consecutive 
numbers can be in any order.

Examples:

Input: [1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20 , 2]
Output: 4
[1, 3, 4, 2] is the longest subsequence of consecutive elements.
