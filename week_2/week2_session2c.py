Bonus Problem: Destination City
You are given the array paths, where paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi] means there exists a direct path going from cityAi to cityBi. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

Example 1:

Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo" 
Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".

Example 2:

Input: paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: All possible trips are: 
"D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A". 
"B" -> "C" -> "A". 
"C" -> "A". 
"A". 
Clearly the destination city is "A".

Example 3:

Input: paths = [["A","Z"]]
Output: "Z"

Understand what the interviewer is asking for by using test cases and questions about the problem.  
Match what this problem looks like to known categories of problems, e.g. Linked List or Dynamic Programming and strategies or patterns in those categories.  
Plan the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.  
Implement the code to solve the algorithm.  
Review the code by running specific example(s) and recording values (watchlist) of your code's variables along the way.  
Evaluate the performance of your algorithm and state any strong/weak or future potential work.
