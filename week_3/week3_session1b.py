Problem #2: Linked List Cycle
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. For simplicity, assume the linked list cannot have more than 1000 nodes in it.

Examples:

This linked list would return True

Image of circular Linked List with values in order 3,2,0,4 and pointer from 4 to 2
    3 -> 2 -> 0 -> 4 -> 2
This linked list would return False

Image of single linked list with value of 1
    1

UMPIRE  
Understand what the interviewer is asking for by using test cases and questions about the problem.  
Match what this problem looks like to known categories of problems, e.g. Linked List or Dynamic Programming and strategies or patterns in those categories.  
Plan the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.  
Implement the code to solve the algorithm.  
Review the code by running specific example(s) and recording values (watchlist) of your code's variables along the way.  
Evaluate the performance of your algorithm and state any strong/weak or future potential work.
