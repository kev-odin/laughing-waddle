Problem #1: Shortest Unsorted Subarray

Given an array, find the length of the smallest subarray in it which when sorted will sort the whole array.

Examples:

Input: [1, 2, 5, 3, 7, 10, 9, 12]
Output: 5
Explanation: We need to sort only the subarray [5, 3, 7, 10, 9] to make the whole array sorted

Input: [1, 3, 2, 0, -1, 7, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: We need to sort only the subarray [1, 3, 2, 0, -1] to make the whole array sort

UMPIRE
