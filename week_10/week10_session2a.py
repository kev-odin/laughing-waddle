Problem #1: Print Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, print all its leaf nodes from left to right

Extra Challenge: 
If we are asked to print the leaf nodes from right to left, how would you change your solution?

U:
    bao: What if the tree only have right leaf nodes? Print the only leaf node
    far: Agree with others
    jes: There are leaf nodes at different levels? Yes
    kev: Can the input tree be null? Assume that the tree is not null
    tin: What are height and depth of the tree? 1-infinity
    xin: Can we use extra space? Any space constraints?  Yes, no constraint
M:
Depth-first Search
Recursion
üçû first search
P:
Base case:
Check if the root is not null

Traverse down the tree from the left and then the right.
Check if the node have any children (if the node is a leaf node or not), if not then print the node.
I:
R:
E:
    Time: O(N) or O(h)
    Space: O(1)
